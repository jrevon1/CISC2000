# Computer Science II

A collection of classwork submitted as part of my Advanced C++ programming course.

## InflationRate
  Several files in a progressive project to ultimately calculate multiple inflation rates based on input data, and sort the rates from smallest to largest.
  
## minilabs
  Smaller projects completed as classwork

## simple-test
A description to be placed for simple-test

## GaltonBoard.cpp
  This program creates a Galton board, represented as a 2-dimensional array. 
  Using dynamic memory allocation, it simulates a ball falling a chosen number of times through a chosen number of rows using a chosen pseudo-random seed, before finally displaying the results, then freeing the dynamic memory allocation.
  
## IntArrayPlay
  A program that creates an array from list of up to 20 integers, then inserts, deletes, and finally appends a value to the array.

## Palindrome.cpp
  This program takes a given user input string, creates a copy in lowercase with no punctuation, and compares that string to a reversed copy of itself. The result is stored accordingly in a separate vectors, "palindromes" and "not_palindromes", and subsequently displayed when the user inputs "quit".
  
## RectangleClass.cpp
  A simple class definition of a rectangle. Including constructors, accessor functions to return the width and height, mutator functions to change the width and height, and a function to determine if the rectangle is also a square.
