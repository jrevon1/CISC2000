# RationalClass

## "/Final" 
This is the fully-completed version of the rational class program. It contains:
  * ### main.cpp
   Driver program that uses the rational class
  * ### rational.cpp
   Constructor and member function implementations for the rational class
  * ### rational.h
   Constructor and member function definitions for the rational class

## "/First"
These are the initial rational class program iterations. It contains:
  * ### rationalclass.cpp
   A raw class definition of a rational number (fraction). Includes some constructors, accessor functions to return the numerator and denominator, mutator functions to change the numerator and denominator, and member functions to handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division between two rational class objects. Also includes the driving program to use the rational class object.

  * ### Labrational.cpp
   This is the polished, submitted version of rationalclass.cpp.
